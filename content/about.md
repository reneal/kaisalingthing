Kaisa Ling Thing is currently the only Estonian humorous feminist vaudeville burlesque blues ensemble. Led by singer Kaisa Ling, with Rene Paul on the piano, Argo Toomel on double bass, and Peep Kallas on drums, they present a commentary on current events with the help of a collection of 100-year old songs and original neo-vaudeville with vintage flair, employing theatrical tricks, humour, dancing, audience participation, and deep feelings to shake the listeners to their core.
